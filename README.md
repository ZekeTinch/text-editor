# text-editor

For this assignment I added the plugins for HtmlWebpack, InjectManifest and WebpackPwaManifest while additionally adding babel and the css loaders into the webpack.config.js file.

In the src-sw.js file I used a simple cache for my assets.

In the install.js file I implemented the correct handlers for each section using examples from the course and what I found online.

And finally in the database.js I used the examples from the course and online to add the correct logics.
